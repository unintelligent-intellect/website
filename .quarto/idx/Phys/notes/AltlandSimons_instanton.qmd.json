Therefore, it is effective to reckon motion over the inverted potential: $V\\to-V$. Under this inversion, the potential has two maxima at $q=\\pm a$ and one (local) minimum at $q=0$. Now we can find a classical solution that connects the two potential maxima **in the imaginary time**. \n\nThe classical solution of the Euclidean equation of motion that connects the two potential-maxima is called an **instanton solution**$(-a\\to a)$ while a solution traversing the same path but in the opposite direction is called an **anti-instanton solution**$(a\\to -a)$.\n\nTo proceed, we must first compute the classical action associated with a single-instanton solution.\nHere, the Lagrangian is given by\n\n$$L=\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{q}^2+V(q)$$\n\nBy applying the Euler-Lagrange equation, we get the equation of motion:\n\n$$m\\ddot{q_\\mathrm{cl}}=\\partial_q V(q_\\mathrm{cl})$$\n\nMultiplying the equation by $\\dot{q}$ and integrating over the imaginary time $\\tau$, we get the classical action:\n\n$$\\frac{m\\dot{q}_\\mathrm{cl}^2}{2}=V(q_\\mathrm{cl})+\\mathrm{const.}$$\n\nTo determine the constant, apply the condition: if $q_\\mathrm{cl}=\\pm a,\\;V(q_\\mathrm{cl})=0$\n\n$$\\frac{m\\dot{q}_\\mathrm{cl}^2}{2}=V(q)$$\n\nWith this result, we obtained the classical action of the instanton solution:\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_\\mathrm{inst}&=\\int_{0}^{\\tau}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{q}_\\mathrm{cl}^2+V(q_\\mathrm{cl})\\right) d\\tau\\\\\n&=\\int_{0}^{\\tau}m\\dot{q}_\\mathrm{cl}^2 d\\tau\\\\\n&=\\int_{0}^{\\tau}m\\dot{q}_\\mathrm{cl} \\frac{d q_\\mathrm{cl}}{d\\tau}d\\tau\\\\\n&=\\int_{-a}^{a}m\\dot{q}_\\mathrm{cl} d q_\\mathrm{cl}\\\\\n&=\\int_{-a}^{a}\\sqrt{2mV(q_\\mathrm{cl})} d q_\\mathrm{cl}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNotice that $S_\\mathrm{inst}$ is determined solely by the potential $V(q)$. \n\nHere, we assume $V''(\\pm a)=m\\omega^2$, namely, $V(q)\\simeq \\frac{1}{2}m\\left(q\\mp a\\right)^2$.\nSubstituting this for the following equation and differentiating for $\\tau$,\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{m\\dot{q}^2}{2}&=V(q)\\\\\n\\frac{m\\dot{q}^2}{2}&=\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\left(q\\mp a\\right)^2\\\\\n\\ddot{q}&=\\omega^2\\left(q\\mp a\\right)\\\\\n(d_\\tau^2-\\omega^2)\\left(q\\mp a\\right)&=0\\\\\nq\\mp a&=Ae^{\\omega\\tau}+Be^{-\\omega\\tau}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants.\nWe don't care about divergent terms, so we set $A=0$.\nFor large $\\tau$, we have $q\\sim \\pm a + Be^{-\\omega\\tau}$. Thus, the time spread of instantons is determined by the oscillator frequency of the local potential minima (the maxima of the inversion potential) and can be considered short if the tunneling occurs on a much larger time scale than that.\n\nThe fact that the instanton configuration is limited to a narrow time interval is important in that there are approximate solutions to the stationary equations involving further anti-instanton and instanton pairs. According to the general idea of the saddle-point method, the path integral is obtained by summing over all solutions of the saddle-point equation, that is, over all instanton configurations. The summation over multiple instanton configurations called **instanton gas**, is greatly simplified by the fact that the transition times of individual instantons are short and the number of instantons that can be accommodated in a finite time interval is dilute without being too large.\n\n# Practical calculation\n\nIn practice, multi-instanton configuations imply a transition amplitude:\n$$G(a,\\pm a;\\tau)\\simeq \\sum_{n\\mathrm{\\;even/odd}} K^n\\int_0^\\tau d\\tau_1 \\int_0^{\\tau_1} d\\tau_2 \\cdots \\int_0^{\\tau_{n-1}} d\\tau_{n} A_n\\left(\\tau_1,\\cdots,\\tau_n\\right)$$\nwhere $A_n$ denotes the amplitude of the $n$-instanton configuration and $K$ is a constant to absorb the dimention $\\mathrm{\\left[time\\right]}^n$. In order to connect $a$ with $\\pm a$, the number of instantons must be even/odd. \n\nIn general, amplitude $A_n$ can be decomposed into a product of two factors: the classical part $A_{n,\\mathrm{cl}}$ and the quantum part $A_{n,\\mathrm{q}}$.\nThe classical contribution $A_{n,\\mathrm{cl}}$ is given by the action of the instanton configuration.\nOn the other hand, the quantum contribution $A_{n,\\mathrm{q}}$ is given by quadratic fluctuations around the classical solution.\n\nBecause each instanton has the same classical action, the classical contribution is given by the following:\n$$A_{n,\\mathrm{cl}}\\left(\\tau_1,\\cdots,\\tau_n\\right)=e^{-nS_\\mathrm{inst}/\\hbar }$$\nwhere $S_\\mathrm{inst}$ is the classical action of a single instanton.\n\nThere are some clues to derive the quantum contribution $A_{n,\\mathrm{q}}$, revoke the fact that quantum fluctuations around a classical configuration which stays for a (real) time $t$ at the bottom of the well result in a factor $\\sqrt{1/\\sin{\\omega t}}$ (the remaining constants are absorbed into the constant $K$). Simply rotating to the imaginary time $t\\to -i\\tau$, we get the factor $\\sqrt{1/\\sinh{\\omega\\tau}}$.
