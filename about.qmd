### Now I'm working on:

- Weyl semimetal / topological insulator (experimental research)
- Page curve (theoretical research)

### I'm interested in

- what kind of (quantum) information processing (quantum) integrable systems, or quantum chaos, are good at, and whether these features are controllable. Keywords are:
    - Analytical Mechanics
    - Quantum Chaos / Quantum Integrable Systems
    - Random Matrix Theory
    - Quantum Entanglement
- complex physical phenomena, especially topological properties, that emerge when units of simple structures are assembled. Keywords are:
    - Topological Phases
    - Statistical Mechanics
    - Quantum Entanglement
    - Topological Quantum Field Theory
- how the geometrical structure of parameter spaces with huge dimensions affects (quantum) information processing. Keywords are:
    - Information Geometry
    - (Quantum) Machine Learning
